# Built-up Area Change Detection in Colombo using Python API( 1975 - 2030) 

## Overview
Rapid urbanization significantly alters the landscape and demands data-driven planning to manage land, infrastructure, and environmental resources effectively. Built-up area monitoring provides critical insights into urban growth patterns, land surface transformation, and infrastructure pressure.

This analysis demonstrates how remote sensing and the JRC GHSL built-up surface dataset can be used to track urban expansion in Colombo, Sri Lanka, between 1975 and 2020. 
Such assessments are crucial for:
1. Urban development planning
2. Infrastructure investment strategies
3. Environmental monitoring
4. Disaster preparedness
5. Sustainable water and land resource management

By calculating annual built-up area and its percentage change over time, this project highlights how cloud-based geospatial tools like Google Earth Engine can support scalable, reproducible, and timely urban monitoring.

## Interpretation of Built-up Area Trends (1975–2030)
1. Consistent Urban Expansion
  The built-up area in the Colombo region increased from 105.09 km² in 1975 to 165.58 km² in 2030.

    This is a total increase of ~60.5 km² over 55 years, indicating steady urban expansion.

2. Growth by Periods

| Period      | Area Increase (km²) | % Growth from Previous |
| ----------- | ------------------- | ---------------------- |
| 1975–1980   | +16.82              | +16.0%                 |
| 1980–1985   | +12.90              | +10.6%                 |
| 1985–1990   | +12.03              | +8.9%                  |
| 1990–1995   | +5.72               | +3.9%                  |
| 1995–2000   | +4.13               | +2.7%                  |
| 2000–2005   | +1.27               | +0.8%                  |
| 2005–2010   | +1.04               | +0.7%                  |
| 2010–2015   | +1.81               | +1.1%                  |
| 2015–2020   | +2.05               | +1.3%                  |
| 2020–2025   | +2.22               | +1.4%                  |
| 2025–2030\* | +0.50               | +0.3%                  |
*The last value is projected/assumed.

#### Key Observations
- Rapid growth occurred from 1975 to 1990, likely reflecting initial urban sprawl, industrialization, and population increase.
- Deceleration after 2000 suggests urban saturation, space constraints, or better planning regulations.
- The projected growth from 2025 to 2030 is minimal, indicating potential stabilization or a shift to vertical rather than horizontal expansion.
